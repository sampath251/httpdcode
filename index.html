        <p> History
Coins from the 4th century during the reign of Valentinian I and a furnace for making clay pots were discovered
 in the area. A map in 1835 displays a small village with only five houses called Crângași between Bucharest, 
Dâmbovița River and Marele Voievod commune. In 1922 a part of the village was integrated in Bucharest. Between 
1940 and 1960 the area was inhabited by poor people which built houses near the river. In the early 60s, 
communist style apartment blocks were built in the area, initially known as the Constructorilor housing estate. It later continued in the mid to late 1980s with 8 to 10 storey apartment blocks. Due to the rise of the Dâmboviţa River the area was frequently flooded. The problem was solved in 1986 when Lacul Morii was built. [1]
